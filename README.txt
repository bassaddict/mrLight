using the development mode:
-development controls must be activated (in the game.xml)
-activate/deactivate MR light development mode with setMRLightDevelopMode true|false
this sets the work speed factor to 100, so it's just the power requirements limiting the work speed

-setting neededPtoPower:
-press CTRL + P
-enter any integer number you want (e.g. 215)
-confirm with enter
this should be the needed power in kw, according to Giants Software

-setting maxForce:
-press CTRL + F
-enter any integer number you want (e.g. 58)
-confirm with enter
this should be the resistance force in kN, according to Giants Software
